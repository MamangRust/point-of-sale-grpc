-- GetTransactions: Retrieves paginated list of active transactions with search capability
-- Purpose: List all active transactions for management UI
-- Parameters:
--   $1: search_term - Optional text to filter transactions by payment method or status (NULL for no filter)
--   $2: limit - Maximum number of records to return (pagination limit)
--   $3: offset - Number of records to skip (pagination offset)
-- Returns:
--   All transaction fields plus total_count of matching records
-- Business Logic:
--   - Excludes soft-deleted transactions (deleted_at IS NULL)
--   - Supports partial text matching on payment_method and payment_status fields (case-insensitive)
--   - Returns newest transactions first (created_at DESC)
--   - Provides total_count for client-side pagination
--   - Uses window function COUNT(*) OVER() for efficient total count

-- GetTransactionsActive: Retrieves paginated list of active transactions (identical to GetTransactions)
-- Purpose: Maintains consistent API pattern with other active/trashed endpoints
-- Parameters:
--   $1: search_term - Optional filter text for payment method/status
--   $2: limit - Pagination limit
--   $3: offset - Pagination offset
-- Returns:
--   Active transaction records with total_count
-- Business Logic:
--   - Same functionality as GetTransactions
--   - Exists for consistency in API design patterns
-- Note: Could be consolidated with GetTransactions if duplicate functionality is undesired

-- GetTransactionsTrashed: Retrieves paginated list of soft-deleted transactions
-- Purpose: View and manage deleted transactions for audit/recovery
-- Parameters:
--   $1: search_term - Optional text to filter trashed transactions
--   $2: limit - Maximum records per page
--   $3: offset - Records to skip
-- Returns:
--   Trashed transaction records with total_count
-- Business Logic:
--   - Only returns soft-deleted records (deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
--   - Maintains same search functionality as active transaction queries
--   - Preserves chronological sorting (newest first)
--   - Used in transaction recovery/audit interfaces
--   - Includes total_count for pagination in trash management UI

-- GetTransactionByMerchant: Retrieves merchant-specific transactions with pagination
-- Purpose: List transactions filtered by merchant ID
-- Parameters:
--   $1: search_term - Optional text to filter transactions
--   $2: merchant_id - Optional merchant ID to filter by (NULL for all merchants)
--   $3: limit - Pagination limit
--   $4: offset - Pagination offset
-- Returns:
--   Transaction records with total_count
-- Business Logic:
--   - Combines merchant filtering with search functionality
--   - Maintains same sorting and pagination as other transaction queries
--   - Useful for merchant-specific transaction reporting
